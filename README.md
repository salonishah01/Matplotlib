# Matplotlib Data Visualization methods

## Correlation

### 1. Scatter Plot

Scatter plot is a classic and fundamental plot used to study the relationship between two variables. If you have multiple groups in your data you may want to visualise each group in a different color. In matplotlib, you can conveniently do this using plt.scatterplot().

### 2. Bubble Plot With Encircling

Sometimes you want to show a group of points within a boundary to emphasize their importance. In this example, you get the records from the dataframe that should be encircled and pass it to the encircle() function.

### 3. Scatter plot with linear regression line of best fit

If you want to understand how two variables change with respect to each other, the line of best fit is the way to go. The below plot shows how the line of best fit differs amongst various groups in the data. To disable the groupings and to just draw one line-of-best-fit for the entire dataset, remove the hue='cyl' parameter from the sns.lmplot().

### 4. Jittering with stripplot

Often multiple datapoints have exactly the same X and Y values. As a result, multiple points get plotted over each other and hide. To avoid this, jitter the points slightly so you can visually see them. This is convenient to do using seabornâ€™s stripplot().

### 5. Counts Plot

Another option to avoid the problem of points overlap is the increase the size of the dot depending on how many points lie in that spot. So, larger the size of the point more is the concentration of points around that.

### 6. Marginal Histogram

Marginal histograms have a histogram along the X and Y axis variables. This is used to visualize the relationship between the X and Y along with the univariate distribution of the X and the Y individually. This plot if often used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### 7. Marginal Boxplot

Marginal boxplot serves a similar purpose as marginal histogram. However, the boxplot helps to pinpoint the median, 25th and 75th percentiles of the X and the Y.

### 8. Correllogram

Correlogram is used to visually see the correlation metric between all possible pairs of numeric variables in a given dataframe (or 2D array).

### 9. Pairwise Plot

Pairwise plot is a favorite in exploratory analysis to understand the relationship between all possible pairs of numeric variables. It is a must have tool for bivariate analysis.-  

### 10. Diverging Bars

If you want to see how the items are varying based on a single metric and visualize the order and amount of this variance, the diverging bars is a great tool. It helps to quickly differentiate the performance of groups in your data and is quite intuitive and instantly conveys the point.
